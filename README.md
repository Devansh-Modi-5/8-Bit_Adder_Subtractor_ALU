# 8-Bit_Adder_Subtractor_ALU
**8‑bit Adder/Subtractor ALU (180 nm CMOS, Cadence Virtuoso)**

* **Breadboard prototyping:** Built and verified an 8‑bit adder/subtractor using a 74LS283 IC, implementing subtraction via carry‑in control and confirming correct sum/difference outputs.
* **Custom‑layout design:** Developed all basic logic gates and the full 8‑bit adder/subtractor schematic and layout in Cadence Virtuoso (180 nm process).
* **Design‑rule and electrical verification:**

  * Ran DRC and LVS to ensure layout‑versus‑schematic consistency and compliance with foundry rules.
  * Performed parasitic extraction (PEX) and antenna checks to validate post‑layout electrical behavior.
* **Post‑layout performance:** Achieved a propagation delay of \~1.6 ns and demonstrated drive capability into a 50 pF load, with a maximum simulated dynamic current of 535 µA.
